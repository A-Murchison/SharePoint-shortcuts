# SharePoint Shortcuts
SharePoint bookmarks that run JavaScript to execute helpful actions 

## Setup 

There are two ways to get started here. We can either create a bookmark bar page or create a code snippet. Whatever works best for you. 

### Bookmark bar
Add a new page to the bookmark bar and add the JavaScript into the URL field.

## Get Internal Name - getInternalName.min.js
Gets the internal name for a column on a list. 

In the below screenshot, you can see that the column with display name 'Test' has the internal name 'Test_x0020_Column'

## Get Site Property bag - getSitePropertyBag.min.js
Gets the current sites property bag XML values and puts them in the console. This usually doesn't fit in the JavaScript 'prompt()' in all browsers so I'm just putting it into the console. 

## Requests
Please raise any request as an issue and I'll do my best to create these for you. Open to give anything a go in JS or C#.
