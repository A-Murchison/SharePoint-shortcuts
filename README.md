# SharePoint Shortcuts
SharePoint bookmarks that run JavaScript to execute helpful actions 

## Setup 

There are two ways to get started here. We can either create a bookmark bar page or create a code snippet. Whatever works best for you. 

### Bookmark bar
Add a new page to the bookmark bar and add the JavaScript into the URL field.

## Get Internal Name - getInternalName.min.js
Gets the internal name for a column on a list.

## Requests
Please raise any request as an issue and I'll do my best to create these for you. Open to give anything a go in JS or C#.
